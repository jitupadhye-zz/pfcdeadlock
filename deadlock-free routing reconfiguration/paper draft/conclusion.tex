\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we demonstrated by concrete cases that cyclic buffer dependency may arise during routing reconfiguration process for both tree based and non-tree based DCNs.  Motivated by this, we developed a solution for achieving fast deadlock-free routing reconfiguration for arbitrary DCNs. 

%Compared with the two-stage static reconfiguration approach, our solution imposes much less constraints on the order of configuration operations, and thus can significantly speed up the routing reconfiguration process.
