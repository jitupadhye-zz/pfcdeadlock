        Find shortest paths from the start vertex to all vertices nearer than or
        equal to the end.

        The input graph G is assumed to have the following representation:
        A vertex can be any object that can be used as an index into a dictionary.
        G is a dictionary, indexed by vertices. For any vertex v, G[v] is itself
        a dictionary, indexed by the neighbors of v. For any edge v->w, G[v][w]
        is the length of the edge from v to w.

        The output is a pair (D,P) where D[v] is the distance from start to v and
        P[v] is the predecessor of v along the shortest path from s to v.

        e.g

        graph = {'a': {'b': 1},
        'b': {'c': 2, 'b': 5},
        'c': {'d': 1},
        'd': {}}
        Returns two dicts, `dist` and `pred`:

        dist, pred = dijkstra(graph, start='a')

        `dist` is a dict mapping each node to its shortest distance from the
        specified starting node:
        assert dist == {'a': 0, 'c': 3, 'b': 1, 'd': 4}

        `pred` is a dict mapping each node to its predecessor node on the
        shortest path from the specified starting node:
        assert pred == {'b': 'a', 'c': 'b', 'd': 'c'}

        Dijkstra's algorithm is only guaranteed to work correctly when all edge
        lengths are positive.
